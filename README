Python GUI to create image with regions/ROIS that we found mentioned in papers on some specific theme

KeyWords: neuroimaging, brain analysis, reviewing, AFNI, uber_ script

Useful when writing review paper on some subject - like: GM and WM structural brain alterations in congenitally deaf

Video on how to use it: https://youtu.be/sU3GUIi45HY

Prerequisites:

- Linux or Mac operating system, because we use shell scripts and AFNI command line tools

- AFNI installed (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/)

- and we need qt4 module fo python (sudo apt-get install python-qt4)


There are quite some options for improvement, that I might address in this file.

- It would be great if ROI volumes would be created with some flooding alghorithm or with iterative loop while masking out just WM or GM and checking actual volume...
